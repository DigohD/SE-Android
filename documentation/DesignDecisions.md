#Design Decisions
During the starting period of developing this app we as a group had to make several decisions regarding the coding and design of the application.

##Android version
When deciding what API level of Android to use we wanted to fulfil the statement *We want to support as many Android users as possible without neglecting any important game functions*. Since we all was relatively new to coding in Android we didn't know all functions we would need to have a well working game. After some research we found that Android 4.0 (API level 14) would support everything that we thought could be useful for the game and in the same time support more than 80% of all Android devices currently active (https://developer.android.com/about/dashboards/index.html).
