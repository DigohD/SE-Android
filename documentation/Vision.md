##Details
We want to develop a piece of entertainment that will be able to compete with the already massive competition that exist on the Android market. The idea is basically to make a challenging arcade game with RPG elements in a sci-fi setting. In order to make it entertaining, leader boards and possibly multiplayer functions will be used, as well as other rewards and goals that will give the player a feeling of accomplishment and progress. The game will be a so-called space shooter, which features a player-controlled space ship that destroys enemy space ships and other objects. While this is the arcade part of the game concept, we also plan to introduce Role Playing elements, such as ship customisation and other decisions to be made by the player. A story line, which to some extent will be affected by the player's decisions, will also help make the game more exciting and diverse. This is what will make our game stand out amongst other space shooters. The target time frame for the project will be approximately six weeks, with twenty hours a week being invested by each group member. There will most likely be no budget at all, except for the fee for sharing our product on the Android market.
